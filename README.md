# The ORT Helper Wrapper (`orthw`) script

`orthw` is a shell script designed to simplify and speed up common tasks performed when processing [ORT][ort]
scan results. It supports a number of commands, which can be run in the terminal (e.g. Bash).
Most of the commands are thin wrappers around the commands provided by [ORT's helper CLI](ort-helper-cli). 

For example:
- To correct license findings in an open source dependency, you can run `orthw pc-create <package-id>`, which generates
  a [package configuration][ort-package-configurations] file.
- To indicate that certain items are internal to the project (and so license findings should not be reported against them), you can generate scope excludes for your project's  [.ort.yml][ort-yml] file with the command `orthw rc-generate-scope-excludes` generates [scope excludes][ort-yml-scope-excludes].

## Benefits of `orthw`

`orthw`:
  - Simplifies common ORT scan review tasks such as clearing found licenses.
  - Offers easy to remember CLI commands (but should you forget, run `orthw` with no arguments to see a complete list).
  - Includes commands to format, sort, clean up and generate ORT config files such as [.ort.yml][ort-yml] and [package configuration][ort-package-configurations].
  - Is pre-configured to work with the [ort-config] repository allowing you to re-use the work of other ORT users.

# Installation

## 1. Prerequisites

`orthw` requires the following tools to be installed on the system where you intend to run it:

* [curl](https://curl.se)
* [md5sum](https://linux.die.net/man/1/md5sum)
* [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/)
* [xz](https://linux.die.net/man/1/xz)

The installation of these tools depends on the operating system:
- Ubuntu Linux: 
  - Run: `sudo apt install coreutils curl openjdk-18-jdk xz-utils -y`
- MacOS: 
  - Install [HomeBrew][homebrew] and run: `brew install curl md5sha1sum openjdk xz`
- Windows using Chocolatey and [Git Bash][git-bash]
  - Install [Chocolatey][chocolatey]
  - Run `choco install curl md5 microsoft-openjdk`
  - Alternatively you can also install Microsoft OpenJDK using Powershell _as administrator_ and run `winget search Microsoft.OpenJDK`
  - Use [Git Bash][git-bash] as your terminal
- Windows using Windows Subsystem for Linux
  - Install [Ubuntu on WSL for Windows 10][ubuntu-wsl-win-10], or [Ubuntu on WSL for Windows 11][ubuntu-wsl-win-11]
  - Run `sudo apt install curl md5sum openjdk-18-jdk xz-utils -y`

 To verify that all the tools have installed correctly, open a new terminal and run:

| Command           | Output starts with                 |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| `curl --version`  | `curl [VERSION_NUMBER]`            |
| `java -version`   | `openjdk version [VERSION_NUMBER]` |
| `md5sum --version`| `md5sum/sha1sum [VERSION_NUMBER]`  |
| `xz --version`    | `xz (XZ Utils) [VERSION_NUMBER]`   |

The next step is to clone the repositories of [ORT][ort], [ort-config], [ScanCode][scancode] and [orthw script][orthw].
Run the commands shown below in a dedicated directory such as `~/ort-project`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ort-project && \
cd ~/ort-project && \
git clone https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort.git && \
git clone https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort-config.git && \
git clone https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/orthw.git && \
git clone https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit.git
```

Finally, create an `exports` directory which will be used to store exported license finding curations and path excludes.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ort-project/exports
```

## 2. Build ORT

Navigate to the directory where you cloned the [ORT][ort] repository and run its [native build][ort-build-native] command:

```bash
cd ~/ort-project/ort && \
./gradlew installDist
```

## 3. Create your `orthw` configuration

- Copy the `orthwconfig-template` file from the orthw repository into your home directory.

```bash
cp ~/ort-project/orthw/orthwconfig-template ~/.orthwconfig
```

- Open `~/.orthwconfig` in a text editor.
- Set `ort_home`, `orthw_home`, `configuration_home` and `scancode_home` to the location of the ORT, orthw, ORT
  configuration and ScanCode repositories which you cloned in above [Prerequisites](#1-prerequisites), respectively.

  If you followed examples in the previous steps and used a `ort-project` directory then
  the contents of `~/.orthwconfig` file should be as follows:

```
configuration_home=~/ort-project/ort-config

ort_home=~/ort-project/ort

scancode_home=~/ort-project/scancode-toolkit

exports_home=~/ort-project/exports

orthw_home=~/ort-project/orthw
```

## 4. Make `orthw` Script Executable Everywhere

To make `orthw` executable everywhere, add a `alias` export to your terminal configuration file.

- Use a text editor to open your terminal launch configuration file e.g. `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.
- Add an alias pointing to the `orthw` script e.g. `alias orthw="bash ~/ort-project/orthw/orthw"`.
- Reload your terminal configuration file e.g. `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc`.

## 5. Test if Everything Works

Verify that `orthw` works by  running `orthw` in a new terminal window: `orthw` should print the full list of available commands and no error messages.
